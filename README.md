# rock-paper-scissors
A rock-paper-scissors game:
- You should click on the images to play and the name on the top with big text size to reset the game
- Built with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS
- Tried to implement a nice UI and a bit complex logic for gameplay
- It is not very animated, gives rather static feel
